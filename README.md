Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) add and remove noise step-by-step to generate images, requiring many steps for quality. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) speed this up by skipping steps, allowing faster sampling. These notebooks explore DDIM, DDPM, and experimenting with prompt-to-prompt multimodal models.
